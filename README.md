# dotfiles
All dotfiles needed to recreate my current setup.

My Setup uses:
* [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as windowmanager
* [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) for input management
* [xst](https://github.com/neeasade/xst) as terminal emulator
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) as shell with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), a framework with supports for lots of plugins


I use [Dotfiler](https://github.com/svetlyak40wt/dotfiler) to centralize my dotfiles.
If you want to clone my settings just set it up and run:

1. `dot add https://github.com/Basanites/dotfiles/` to clone my dotfiles
2. `dot update` to create symlinks to your home directory
