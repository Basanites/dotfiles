# dotfiles
All dotfiles needed to recreate my current setup

I use [Dotfiler](https://github.com/svetlyak40wt/dotfiler) to centralize my dotfiles.
If you want to clone my settings just set it up and run:

1. `dot add https://github.com/Basanites/dotfiles/` to clone my dotfiles
2. `dot update` to create symlinks to your home directory
